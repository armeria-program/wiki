# Keyboard shortcuts

Numerous keyboard shortcuts are available within the MIFit software in order to provide efficient control over document handling, model display and model fitting. Once the shortcuts have been learned, many common operations can be accessed much more rapidly than through the MIFit menus or toolbar.

The tables in this chapter list the keyboard shortcuts that are currently available in MIFit. The notation / is used to indicate two shortcuts that usually have opposite actions. The notation Shift+ indicates simultaneous selection of the Shift key with the following key. The notation Ctrl+ indicates simultaneous selection of the Ctrl key with the following key. Similarly, the notation Alt+ indicates simultaneous selection of the Alt key with the following key.

**4.1 Keyboard shortcuts for document handling**

**Ctrl+N File/New** Create a new structure document

**Ctrl+O File/Open models, data, maps, etc...** Open an existing structure document

**Alt+X Exit** Terminates program

**4.2 Keyboard shortcuts for display**

**X** View along x-axis (from origin)

**Y** View along y-axis (from origin)

**Z** View along z-axis (from origin)

**Left/Right** Rotate left/right about y-axis

**Up/Down** Rotate up/down about x-axis

**Shift+I/Shift+O** Slab in/Slab out (along z-axis)

**I/O** Zoom in/Zoom out

The notations **Left/Right/Up/Down**refer to the arrow cursor keys.

**4.3 Keyboard shortcuts for stereo viewing**

MIFit currently supports side-by-side stereo and also contains a full screen mode (**ESC**keyboard shortcut) that allows the canvas to be expanded to fill the entire monitor screen.

The side-by-side stereo display splits the canvas into a left and right half and displays the left/right eye image in the left/right half respectively. The default stereo display is straight-eye rather than cross-eye stereo. Side-by-side stereo display may also be con-trolled with the menu command **Viewpoint/Stereo**.

**|** Toggle stereo

**A / S** Decrease / Increase stereo angle

**Shift+A / Shift+S** Decrease / Increase stereo angle

**Ctrl+Shift+S** Toggle cross-eyed to wall-eyed stereo

**Q / W** Decrease / Increase stereo separation for the Dictionary Editor

**X** Toggle cross-eyed to wall-eyed stereo for the Dictionary Editor

Table 4.3 Keyboard shortcuts for altering the software stereo settings

Use of hardware stereo requires a quad-buffered video card, CRT monitor, and LCD shutter glasses. If the hardware is available, this form of stereo may be activated using the **Viewpoint/Use Hardware Stereo**command.

**4.4 Keyboard shortcuts for model fitting**

Most of the model-building shortcuts are only active while fitting the model, _i.e._ when one or more residues are selected for modification.

**[| PageUp** Go to N-terminus of chain

**]| PageDown** Go to C-terminus of chain

&lt;/&gt; Insert MRK residue before / after present residue

**Space** Go to next residue

**B** Go to previous residue

**;** Apply fit/ Accept refinement

**C** Select next conformer (side chain)

**D** Delete residue

**F** Fit residue

**R** Replace and fit residue (side chain refitting)

**Ctrl+R** Refine residue

**Shift+W** Add water molecule at cursor center

**Delete** Delete atom

**1/2/.../5** Select χ1, χ2,..,χ5 side chain torsion angle
