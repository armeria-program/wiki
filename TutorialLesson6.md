# Tutorial Lesson: Model and map display using files from the wwPDB

_Scenario: You are working with computational chemists analyzing a structure from the PDB and wish to assess the reliability of the model against the associated electron density map._

1. Copy files _2IIV.pdb_and _2iiv-sf.cif_from the _examples_directory of your MIFit installa-tion into a new directory. These are the coordinate and diffraction data files that can be downloaded from the PDB web sites. The diffraction data file is in mmCIF format.

2. Use the MIFit command **File/Open models, data, maps, etc**to load coordinate file _2IIV.pdb_from the directory in which you placed it. The structure will appear in the main canvas. You will notice that the crystal data, displayed next to the crystal icon in the navigation tree, is correct.

3. Use the command **File/Open models, data, maps, etc**to load data file _2iiv-sf.cif_. Although this file did not contain any space group or cell information you will notice that the crystal data displayed next to the corresponding crystal icon is correctly copied from the coordinate file. In the Phase file import dialog box the **Map Type** parameters are standard 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc maps. The **Fc** and **Phase** parameters will show that the model will be used to calculate structure factors and phases. Select the 2Fo-Fc map using the check box. After a mouse click on **OK**, some diagnostic information on this calculation will appear in the **Log**pane in the lower left. You will see that the R-factor in this calculation is 0.263, which is a reasonable value. Note that reported R-factors are a function of a number of factors including scaling methods, bulk solvent correction and data limits and rarely correspond exactly to the results of an independent recalculation. Note 1: If the model was refined using TLS treatment of thermal parameters there may be problems in calculating an accurate map since the atomic thermal parameters in the PDB file ATOM/HETATM records may not represent the full values. Note 2: A more refined map, computed using likelihood weighted coefficients and utilizing additional data to model scaling parameters, may be obtained by performing a brief refinement run with CCP4/REFMAC5 program and using the resulting map coefficients as described in the next lesson.

5. With a right mouse button click on the map icon in the **Models List** section of the navigation tree use the **Contour options...**interface to move the **Radius**slider to about 10 in order to set a 10 box for the map volume. You may also wish to set the **Preset Map Styles**option to Blue Map, 1,2,3,4,5 sigma and then uncheck the display of contour levels 2 and 4 to remove some of the contour lines from the map display. You may also wish to use the slider to slightly increase the lowest density value (say, from 50 to 60). Select **OK**and you will see the map view change to these settings.

6. At the top pane of the navigation enter A 9001 in the **Go to residue**text box at the top of the tree control and click on the **GoTo**button. The canvas view should re-center on the ligand (entity '565'). In this case the ligand is very well defined and makes a good fit to the map.

7. You may select **File/Close**or **File/Exit**to close this session or shut down MIFit.
