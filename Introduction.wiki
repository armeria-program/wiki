#summary Introduction to MIFit

= Introduction =

MIFit (pronounced em-ī-fit) is a molecular graphics program for protein crystal structure determination that runs on Windows and Linux operating systems. Besides capabilities for model-building and protein structure display, MIFit also provides interfaces that apply third-party crystallographic software (d*TREK, the CCP4 suite and SHELX) for image data processing, SAD phasing, molecular replacement and refinement. These crystallographic applications are managed by a program called MIExpert. A particular focus of the MIFit/MIExpert software is the efficient solution and analysis of protein:ligand complexes.

MIFit has been possible through the efforts of many people throughout its history, in particular, Duncan McRee, Russ Athay, John Badger, Jon Christopher, and Paul Collins.

The automated error checking capabilities used by MIFit’s automated refinement script employs probability data on phi-psi distributions provided by the Richardson laboratory (Lovell et al., Proteins 50:437-450, 2003).

The data for the SAD phasing tutorial was supplied by Aiping Dong (Structural Genomics Consortium, University of Toronto) and corresponds to PDB entry 2AZP.
Many of the structures and data sets used in the tutorials were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org).
