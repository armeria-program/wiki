#summary Basics of the MIFit User Interface

= Launching MIFit =

On computers with a Linux operating system, MIFit may be started from the command line by simply executing the MIFit program that is found in the top level of the MIFit installation directory. It is not necessary to set any environment variables to run MIFit. However if you intend to run CCP4 applications from MIFit, the environment settings for CCP4 should be established prior to launch.

On computers with a Windows operating system, MIFit may be launched either by double-clicking on the MIFit desktop icon or by selecting All Programs/MIFit/MIFit from the Start menu.

= Main Window =

Starting MIFit launches a window like shown below. The intial window shows the usual menu and tool bars, as well as, docked views on the left and bottom sides. The Model view on the left contains a tree representation of the document and the Log view on the bottom displays log information output by the program. In tabs underneath each of these views are other views: Display for manipulation of atom labels and annotations, Jobs for managing automated jobs, Python for interactive scripting.

= Opening model, diffraction data and map files =

A document that already exists may be opened using the *File/Open models, data, maps, etc…* command (keyboard shortcut *Ctrl+O*). This command is used to load structure data from session (.mlw) or coordinate (.pdb) files. Files associated with atomic models that have been the subject of recent work are also kept in a history list displayed in the File menu.

A group of files can be opened at once using the open command. Holding down Ctrl or Shift allows multiple selections. When a group of coordinate files are loaded together they are automatically color-coded if the *File/Preferences…* setting *Incrementally color additional models* is checked. An additional setting *Render/Dim Non-active Models* may be deselected in order to view all models with equal visibility.

Diffraction data files and pre-computed electron density maps in the CCP4 or XtalView formats are also loaded into MIFit with the *File/Open models, data, maps, etc…* command.

= Creating a new document =

A new MIFit document may be created with the *File/New…* command (keyboard shortcut *Ctrl+N*). The *File/Open models, data, maps, etc…* may then be used to add content to the current document. To open files in a different document, use *File/Open into new document…* command.

Under the Windows operating system, individual document windows may be cascaded, tiled vertically or tiled horizontally. Under the Linux operating system, each document window always covers the whole document area and has a tab attached at the top. Clicking on the tab of a document brings its window to the top. The Windows version of MIFit contains an additional Window menu with which the arrangement of the document window may be controlled.
